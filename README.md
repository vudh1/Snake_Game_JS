# Snake_Game_JS

## Description

Inspired by the popular Snake Game, I created my own Snake Game applying Finding Path by DFS. My version does not have border, which means the snake can run through the wall and appear on the other side. Every time the snake eats an apple, it increases its length and speed as well. We can control the snake with arrow buttons or the snake will run itself toward the apple.
