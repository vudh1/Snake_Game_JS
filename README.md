# Snake_Game_JS

## Description

Inspired by the popular Snake Game, I want to try to use HTML, CSS and Javascript to create my own Snake Game. My version does not have border, which means the snake can run through the wall and appear on the other side. Every time the snake eats an apple, it increases its length and speed as well.
